This repository features a simple yet effective implementation of an accessible 
modal popup using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The modal provides a user-friendly 
interface for displaying important messages or content without the need to 
navigate away from the current page.
Designed with responsiveness in mind, it adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a 
seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
